Despite not holding an officer role, I had a strong presence within the club and contributed to the club at every opportunity.

During my time with the ACM Organization at Georgia Southern, I had:
- Provided a cheerful and inviting environment
- Assisted with setting up and planning guest speakers
- Networked with recruiters, professional developers, and alumni
- Further improved my interpersonal skills
