This experience had opened my eyes to the dynamics of an office environment. I presented myself everyday with high energy and a positive attitude. In addition to this, I had given maximum effort and had high quality interpersonal interactions.

My responsibilities in this role included:
- Scanning documents into the office's system
- Occasional assembly and repair of office furniture
- Upkeep of the breakroom
