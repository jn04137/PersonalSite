This experience had opened my eyes to the dynamics of an office environment. Everyone had worked together to make sure operations were running smoothly.

My responsibilities in this role included:
- Scanning documents into the office's system
- Occasional assembly and repair of office furniture
- Up-keep of the breakroom
