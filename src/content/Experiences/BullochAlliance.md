This was a beginning of an FRC that would provide STEM education and outreach events for the entirety of Bulloch County. FRC Team 3998 was attached to one specific school. Some of the mentors and I had decided to branch out and begin a new team that would go on to work with all schools within the Bulloch County area.

My responsibilities and accomplishments from this experience included:
- Successfully recruited students from three+ different schools in the area
- Taught programming principles and WPILIB api (**Java**)
- Taught self-driven students in an external program how to setup and program **Raspberry Pi's** (**Python**, **Linux**, **SSH**)
- Planned multiple multi-day trips for competitions
  - Booked hotel rooms and managed how students were separated
- Handled the team's budget with an emphasis on sustainability
