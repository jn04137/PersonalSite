It was a privilege to support a team that I was previously a part of. The following were my accomplishments and responsbilities in this position:
- Led the design and fabrication of the competition robot
- Assisted in teaching basic programming principles to students
- Provided and advocated for a safe, supportive, and inclusive working environment for all students
- Was present nearly every day within the build season to ensure that students had as much time as possible
- Increased my time of attendance as we had neared competition dates (4 P.M. - 1 A.M.) to give students more time to finish tasks

As a team we had competed at World's in Houston, Texas and ranked __23 out of 67__ teams in _Galileo Division 2019_.
