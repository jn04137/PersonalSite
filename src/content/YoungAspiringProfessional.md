## My Past

When people asked what I wanted to be, I would never have a solid response. Being a first-gen American born in rural Georgia, there wasn't a clear path to follow while growing up. To my family, becoming a doctor meant great prestige and financial stability. It was consistently mentioned to me through lower, middle, high -school and my undergrad. Keeping my morale up became a little mini-game that would . 

Initially, I had chosen to study Computer Science because I had a strong affinity for technology and computing devices. By the age of 12 I had built my first computer to properly play graphic intensive games. Since then, I have built another four or five computers for myself, family members, and friends.

During my junior and senior years in high-school, I had competed in FIRST Robotics and was the captain of the team during my senior year. My first year on the team, we had qualified to compete at the World Championship, but everyone's schedule was not aligned to attend the event. We forego World's in 2017 and come back next season as a powerhouse of a team. Our robot had one of the highest scores for performance in autonomous.

I could have chosen Computer Engineering as my major, but I decided on Computer Science because the idea of creating complete products with learned knowledge and concepts without consuming physical materials was so appealing to me. 

Born and raised in Statesboro, Georgia, I was an above average student growing up. With no clear direction in my early life, I knew that I needed to build some foundation to secure a bright and prosperous a future. My mentality through high-school was to get put in B+ performance and hope for A results. As you can see, I was already implementing the 80/20 rule from the start. With this, I graduated from my high school, Bulloch Academy, with a GPA of 3.8.

College life was straightforward. I had attended Georgia Southern University. Because I had an SAT score above 1200 and a GPA higher than 3.7, I had qualified for Zell Miller [This scholarship covers all tuition]. Also staying in my hometown to further my education meant that I would save on living expenses. This had allowed me to fully focus on my studies. During this period of my life, I treated my courses as treasure-troves and absorbed as much as I could.
