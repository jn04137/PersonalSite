## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Jonathan Nguyen. If you're wondering how my last name is pronounced, don't worry about it! It's pretty much just "Win". Now that we have that out of the way, let's get into it. 
## Education ðŸŽ“
I had studied Computer Science at Georgia Southern University from August of 2018 to May of 2022. During my time in university, I had learned software development standards, how to produce formal documentation, the actual process of software development, data structures, algorithms, Linux, and much more.
## Leisurely Exploration [_In Tech_] ðŸ—º
During my own time, I would go off and learn web development tools. With that, I had spent a fair amount of time playing with Linux distributions to standardize the development experience between my desktop and my Macbook. 

Overall, the distribution I decided on doesn't matter too much [_I use Arch_], but the process of installing and setting up a variety of distributions gave me a better understanding of Linux/MacOS, the terminal, and CLI tools. This alone has made me a much better programmer as it gave me the experience to create a much more catered developer experience allowing for more productivity.
## Preferences ðŸ¤—
My programming language of choice right now is Javascript. My editor of choice is Neovim and I use VS Code [_with VIM keybindings_] when I can't find a sufficient LSP for a new toy project. 
## Constant Self-Improvement ðŸŒŸ
I am currently experimenting with NextJS in a personal project. For this project, I am looking at Vercel and PlanetScale for hosting and data storage at scale. 

As for this site, it was created using Astro Build and is being served to you with the help of Vercel.

There is genuine excitement that builds within me when fresh updates and new frameworks are released. In my humble opinion, this field of work has a high skill skilling, and the returns from learning and keeping up to date increase the number of fulfilling opportunities that we, as developers, can grasp and take even further.
