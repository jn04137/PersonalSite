## Hello!

My name is Jonathan Nguyen. For those wondering how my last name is pronounced, don't worry about it! It's pretty much just "Win". Now that we have that out of the way, I had studied Computer Science at Georgia Southern from August of 2018 to May of 2022. During my time in university, I had learned software development standards, how to produce formal documentation, the actual process of software development, data structures, algorithms, Linux, etc.

During my own time, I would go off and learn how to use Web-Dev tools. With that, I had spent a fair amount of time playing with Linux distros trying to find the perfect one for me. The distribution doesn't matter, but the process of installing a variety of distributions gave me a better understanding of Linux/MacOS. This alone made me a much better programmer as it gave me the experience to create a much more catered developer experience for myself.

My programming language of choice as of right now is Javascript. My editor of choice is Neovim and I use VS Code (with VIM keybindings) when I can't find a sufficient LSP for a new toy project. I am currently experimenting with NextJS in a personal project. Currently, I am looking at Vercel and PlanetScale as potential platforms to support my project. This site was created using Astro Build and is currently being hosted on Vercel.

I genuinely get excited when fresh updates and new frameworks are released. In my humble opinion, this field of work has a high skill skilling, and the returns from learning and keeping up to date are well worth it.
