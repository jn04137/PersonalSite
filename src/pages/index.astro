					<p class="text-xl">
						I thoroughly enjoy writing applications with Javascript. I personally find that Javascript
						and its ecosystem of frameworks allows for developers to quickly prototype and develop products.
					</p>
					<p class="text-xl">
						But I don't limit myself to only Javascript. I stand behind the thought of using the best tool for the job.
						Therefore, I have made it a habit to read news articles and consume media regarding the newest technologies
						to make sure I have the most optimal tool for any problem. Over the years, I have found myself
						learning and utilizing these technologies in my projects:

						Graduated from Georgia Southern University in May of 2022 with a GPA of 3.8. During my years in college,
						I had learned Javascript and many Javascript frameworks on top of my curriculum. My skillsets
						and passion are biased towards full-stack web development technologies which includes but not limited to
						Docker, Nginx, and Linux. Recently, the main technologies that I have taken the time to work with
						are Next.js and Astro Build (for this website).

					<p class="text-lg tracking-wide">
						I am a GIANT fan of the VIM keybindings and movements. I am so much of a fan that I install
						the official Vim plugin for every IDE that I use. My main editor of choice is Neovim and I use VSCode
						when there is not a proper lsp for the filetype of the project that I am working on.
